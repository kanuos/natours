Natours landing page using HTML and vanilla CSS
This site uses basic HTML with vanilla CSS to re-create and style the Natours landing page originally created and designed by Jonas Schmedtmann.

I have used modern CSS layouts like flexbox and grid system instead of the float system or third party grid systems.
